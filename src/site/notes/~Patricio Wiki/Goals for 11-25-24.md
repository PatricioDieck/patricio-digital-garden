this goal setting isnt as good as **last week's** - [link](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=~Patricio%20Wiki%2FGoals%20for%2011-17-24)
- OG source of truth 
- practice thinking this way 
	- setiting up the system 
		- parameters for success and failiure 
	- improvement/study of the system 

**hard and fast rule : there are no hard and fast rules** 

notes 
- start the day with frist principles breakdowns -  **there’s no replacement for thinking**
	- hardest thing of the day first, make something ppl want, then coding, then learning in CC
	- sundays for goal setting and review 
- Leave your personal issues and problems outside of the field 
	- This is your Super Bowl training. Bring the best and all you have to training.
	- Firewall your training from the external world
	- This is the first principle of professionalism- be deadly and leave the world when you are working.
	- You wouldn’t expect an NFL player or navy seal to be thinking about their personal problem while executing a play. They just are executing.
## Goals in material life


- Note to self : should I be systematizing only my market activities? 
	- might be good to later add spiritual goals 
		- romantic goals, familial goals etc...
	- i guess for now we can just do market goals 
		- for whole happiness, it will later be important to do this process systematically to all facets of my life
			- externalize, materialize and iterate on all of this aspects will definitely improve them 
	- **idk why im just doing market goals?**
		- i think bc financial independence seems like a current priority?
		- **wow this is actually quite surprising**
		- maybe bc i seem to be the least productive in this area of life?
			- or is it bc everybody else is more competent in market and comparably incompetent in spirit and family???
			- idk - either way - we will figure these out in the coming months 
			- retrospects will be crucial in understanding shit down the road. 

- **Learning algo:**
	- Prelim mind map of initial understanding  
	- Read primary source (if cumbersome, find something manageable)
	- Generalize/mind map its first principles
	- Get a compressed understanding 
	- Implement basic example (too ambitious?)

- **I AM the product** 
	- my ability to think through problems 
	- ability to reason from foundational truths
	- ability to adapt to environment changes and receive/improve from feedback 
		- all crucial to the highest order functioning of my brain
		- being connected to god as my fountain of truth, beauty, and light 
	- my character, attitude, looks, and treatment of the world
- no goals === fucking around
- I take longer than i expect in tasks (about 3x)
	- is bc i am learning and am generous with time + detours 
	- adjust estimates of time to reflect this?
## **goals for this week** 

**become financially independent** 
- finish and create a real Solana coin

	- why my failures should be public 
		- retrospect on them 
		- not pretend I'm a genius if they go right
