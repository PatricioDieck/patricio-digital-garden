this is a collection of all the software running in my head.

Here are some ideas that govern my decision-making.

- Tim urban blog - chef and the cook
- Farnam street- how to think better, blank sheet note taking, first principles 
- Bible - esp. genesis, matthew/gospels 
- almanac of naval
- systemantics
- mircea eliade sacred and profane 
- rich dad poor dad
- apple WWDC 2014- start with customer experience and work backwards
- concept mapping 
- PG - make something people want

2 important definitions:
- **system** : *set of parts coordinating to accomplish a set of goals*
	- a system is only as good as its sensory organs (feedback/metrics)
	- systems tend to operate in failiure modes
- **first principles** : propositions or assumptions that stand on their own
	- self evident truths
	- only stable source of knowledge 
		- remove faulty assumptions, conventions, social boilerplate

imperative to keep a clear system/record of the subsystems i am activelly refining 
- this allows for feedback, assesment of sucess and failiure
	- course correction and optimization
	- avoiding failiure modes
- thinking about my skills, learning and approach as its own discipline

how am i going about this 
- defining ongoing systems
	- sunday edit + review (system/goals)
	- set tasks to goals (ongoing/single)
- clear knowledge management
	- files/folders with valuable personal knowledge
	- review, update, creating
- goal setting 
	- clear sucess/failiure definitons
