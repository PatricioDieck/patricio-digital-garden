### **failiures and successes of last week** 
- failed/sucessful outcomes 

- # success
	- learned what first principles are
		- a proposition or assumption that stands on its own, cant be derived from other pricniples (self-evident)
	- am systematizing my learning - *system: set of parts coordinated to accomplish a set of goals*
		- systems -> useless w/o goals, same for goals w/o systems 
		- starting to systematize processes for getting shit done 
			- setting up weekly goals and systems to get there 
	- rigorous about what constitutes knowledge/learning 
		- socratic method of questioning (farnam st first principles)
		- faynman technique (if you cant explain to a 5yr old, then you dont know it)
	- focus on the things that matter
		- my thinking is the product 
			- one improvent in thinking is propagated into every decision made 
			- knowledge has strong compounding properties 
			- refinind thinking has high alpha
	- thinking without writing isnt thinking 
		- there is no substitute for thinkng, cant be outsourced
			- it is the clearing funciton for thoughts, ideas, behavior, etc. 
		- writing is how you reflect and improve on your execution 
		- not iterating on execution is stagnation (this must be a concious process)
	- first principles are conducive to powerful thinking patterns : 
		- manipulating material world 
		- best work is always approached as a **learning** problem rather than an **execution** problem 
			- iterate without emotional friction 
			- places clear thinking as the apex of execution (*read that again*)
				- i.e execution is subordinate to clear thinking 
		- allows you to deconstruct your thinking
			- erase unessential assumptions (bloat, dogma, parasitic assumptions, etc.)
			- makes you not emotional and identified with your knowledge
			- allows you to conciously manipulate and improve your thinking
	- deconstructed how cryptocurrencies work 
		- refer to crypto [[ðŸ§  Programming/ðŸ’° Crypto/FP - MindMap\|ðŸ§  Programming/ðŸ’° Crypto/FP - MindMap]]
	- deconstructed jesus
		- first principles destructive in spiritual realm
			- emergent properties of faith are more valuable than elements 
			- usefull for understanding, not for faith 
		- faith is bedrock of the material world, substrate of life 
	- came up with PatoWiki
		- state goals - sucesses and failiures (hopefully falsifiable)
		- display software running in my head 
	- small conscious learning every day is conducive to good mental faculties 
		- bash CodeCademy 
			- first principles of file systems, files, and text 
		- python modules and packages are just files and functions 

- failiures 
	- didnt go to bed at 9 any day of the week
	- lack of sleep --> lack of productivity
		- spent most of the time aimlessly fucking around
	- lesson : go to sleep at 9 every day- be strict about its enforcement 
		- failiure to do this will equate to failiure in every other aspect of life
			- unfocused coding, lack of foresight, vision, slave mindset, etc.
	- no meaningful programming done 
		- I'm fearful of starting from scratch 
		- impostor syndrome, im falling behind, not adressing this 
		- i dont know what to build
			- I dont know if it will be sucessfull
			- i have no proof that people need my solution 
	- no meaningful learning done 
		- most learning gets done while executing, didnt execute
	- not talking to my customers
		- i am not doing research into their problems
		- i am letting my ego decide for them the solution they want 
	- no feedback systems to tell me if im fuckng up
		- fixing this runway feedback for next week 
	- whacked off 3x 
	- didnt pack lunches correctly - failed to put eggs in my backpack
		- low energy throught day
		- no improvement in my physique (decline)
